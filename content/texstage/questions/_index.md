## General Usage

### Can I use TexStage for non-Beamer PDFs?
While TexStage is optimized for Beamer presentations, it can handle other PDF formats as well. However, certain features, like presenter notes and advanced slide transitions, may not work as expected with non-Beamer PDFs.

## Cross-Platform Usage

### Can I sync my presentations across Mac and iOS devices?
Yes, TexStage supports syncing presentations between macOS and iOS through iCloud. You can start a presentation on your Mac and continue it on your iPhone or iPad seamlessly using iCloud Drive. Ensure that iCloud is enabled on both devices and that your presentation files are stored in a location synced with iCloud.

### Can I control my Mac presentation using my iPhone or iPad?
Not at the moment but the feature is in TODO list.

## Mobile-Specific Questions

### Can I present offline on my iPhone or iPad?
Yes, TexStage allows you to present offline on your iPhone or iPad. Simply ensure that your Beamer PDF files are downloaded to your device before starting the presentation. This way, you can access the slides even without an internet connection.

### Does TexStage support cloud syncing on mobile devices?
Yes, TexStage supports cloud syncing with services like iCloud, Dropbox, and Google Drive. On iOS, you can directly import Beamer PDFs from your cloud storage accounts into the app. Once imported, you can present offline or make edits while online.
