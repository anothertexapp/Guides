### App Crashes or Freezes

If TexStage crashes or freezes during a presentation, try the following:
- **Restart the app**: Quit TexStage completely and reopen it.
- **Update to the latest version**: Ensure that you are using the most recent version of TexStage by checking for updates in the App Store.
- **Restart your device**: A simple device restart can often resolve software glitches.
- **Check file size**: If the presentation file is large, it might be causing performance issues. Try optimizing or reducing the file size of your Beamer PDF.

### Display Issues with Beamer Slides

If your Beamer slides aren't displaying correctly, try these solutions:
- **Check PDF format**: Ensure that your PDF file is properly generated with Beamer. TexStage is optimized for Beamer-generated PDFs.
- **Re-import the PDF**: Sometimes reloading the PDF can resolve display problems.
- **Ensure external displays are properly connected**: If you're using an external monitor or projector, double-check that the connection is secure, and that the display settings in TexStage are configured correctly.

### External Display Issues on macOS

If your presentation isn't showing on an external monitor:
- Ensure your Mac is connected properly via HDMI, DisplayPort, or Thunderbolt.
- Go to **System Preferences > Displays** and make sure the correct display is selected.

### Hotkeys Not Responding on macOS

If hotkeys or keyboard shortcuts aren't working:
- Ensure TexStage is the active window.
- Try restarting your Mac and reopening TexStage.

### Issues with File Imports on iOS

If you can’t import files from iCloud, Google Drive, or other cloud services:
- Make sure you have granted TexStage permission to access these services in **Settings > TexStage > Files**.
- Ensure you’re logged into the correct cloud service account and have network access.
- Try re-importing the file after restarting the app.

### External Display Doesn’t Work on iOS

If TexStage isn’t showing up on an external monitor or projector:
- Check your AirPlay connection.
- Ensure **Screen Mirroring** is enabled for AirPlay
