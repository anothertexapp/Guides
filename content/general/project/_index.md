Welcome to the heart of our LaTeX and PDF applications project! This suite is designed to make the process of writing, editing, and presenting academic documents easier, faster, and more enjoyable for researchers, students, and professionals alike. Here, you’ll find everything you need to know about the project’s vision, roadmap, and the collaborative forum where you can connect with other users, share your insights, and help shape the future of these tools.

### About the Project

This project was born from a desire to build the ideal tools for managing academic and research documents in LaTeX and PDF formats. Each application in the suite has been crafted to address specific challenges faced in the research community. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive set of applications that will support you throughout the entire lifecycle of academic work, whether you're drafting a thesis, editing research, or presenting your findings. The suite includes four core applications, each with a unique function:

1. **TexEdit**: The ultimate IDE for LaTeX, packed with tools for collaborative document creation.
2. **TexDraw**: A powerful tool for diagramming, essential for illustrating complex ideas.
3. **TexReview**: An app focused on simplifying the process of reading and reviewing others' work.
4. **TexStage**: A solution for presenting Beamer PDFs with a simple one-click setup.

Each app will be released as soon as it's functional, and feedback is highly encouraged at every stage. [NeededApps](https://neededapps.com) will finance all necessary resources, ensuring that each tool is reliable, and continuously improving.

### Why Join the Forum?

This forum is also where we’ll share news about development progress, plans for future updates, and opportunities for user-driven development. Whether you’re a seasoned researcher or a student just starting out, your ideas and feedback are invaluable to us.

### A Collaborative Roadmap

As Mark Zuckerberg once said, ***Ideas don’t come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them.*** This project is no exception. We are committed to developing these applications in close collaboration with users, refining our vision and roadmap as we go.

The roadmap for the suite is planned as follows:

- **TexStage** – Planned for Winter 2024
- **TexReview** – Also scheduled for Winter 2024
- **TexDraw** – Targeted for release in Spring 2025
- **TexEdit** – Expected in Winter 2025
